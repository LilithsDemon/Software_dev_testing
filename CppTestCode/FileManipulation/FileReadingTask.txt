Joke's on you,
a single mouth is nowhere near enough to
consume all of this food that I've prepared!
Kate will never be able to eat all this!
King Henry the 8th himself couldn't 
ingest this feast!
Massive quantities of food will overwhelm even the 
most inhumane individuals.
I have truly done it!
Now no-one in the world will
starve.
